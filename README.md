```javascript
Nightmare: Into the Deep, is an click adventure game that takes you through puzzles to escape! Your choices that you choose determines your outcome, so I would advise you to think twice before choosing an answer. 

I chose this game because the genre most intrested me. For what I wanted to build, a choose your own adventure game gave me the capability to freely explore the connection between the three languages (javascript, html, and css). I also had a lot of fun incorporating media with code.
